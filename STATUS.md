# Project Status Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-27

## Purpose

`STATUS.md` is the current-state handoff file for coding agents. Use it to resume work without re-deriving the active branch, milestone, gate, verification state, blockers, and next action from scratch.

Authoritative sources remain:

- `AGENTS.md`: permanent project rules and safety boundaries.
- `PRD.md`: product requirements and project scope.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: milestone roadmap, build tasks, verification, and exit gates.
- `API_VERIFICATION.md`: required external API verification checklist.
- `verification/*.md`: dated evidence logs.
- `STATUS.md`: current handoff context.

## Current Branch

- Branch: `m3/feed-ingestion-normalization`
- Short commit: `8de9085`
- Worktree status: M3 implementation and verification fixes are present; `.cursor/rules/30-development-workflow.mdc`, `STATUS.md`, source/config changes, and `verification/2026-04-27-m3-api-verification.md` are uncommitted.

## Milestones

- Last completed milestone: M3 - Feed Ingestion And Normalization.
- Active milestone: M4 - In-Memory State And Order Books.
- Next milestone: M5 - Signal And Risk Engine.

## M3 Scope Lock

M3 proved read-only feed ingestion and normalization. It did not promote `paper` or `replay` into live runtimes.

M3 includes:

- API verification sections 4, 5, 9, and 10.
- `validate --feed-smoke` checks for Polymarket CLOB, Binance, and Coinbase.
- REST `/book` snapshot normalization into `BookSnapshot`.
- Raw and normalized event persistence.
- Feed health/staleness observability.

M3 explicitly defers:

- Full live paper runtime.
- Strategy execution and simulated order placement from live feeds.
- Replay execution over captured feed sessions.
- Live resolution-source ingestion until API section 11 confirms the actual settlement source/subscription behavior.

Stubbed runtime status remains intentional:

```text
paper_mode_status=stubbed_until_later_milestones
replay_status=stubbed_until_later_milestones
```

## M3 Acceptance Matrix

| Gate item | Status | Evidence / decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API sections 4, 5, 9, 10 | PASS | See `verification/2026-04-27-m3-api-verification.md`. |
| Polymarket `validate --feed-smoke` | PASS | Connected read-only; raw and normalized events persisted. |
| Binance `validate --feed-smoke` | PASS | Connected read-only; trade tick normalized. |
| Coinbase `validate --feed-smoke` | PASS | Connected read-only; ticker messages normalized; one non-ticker/control message preserved as unknown. |
| REST `/book` snapshot to `BookSnapshot` | PASS | Live snapshot recovery probe normalized one snapshot. |
| Raw plus normalized persistence | PASS | Final live gate persisted 6 raw messages and 6 normalized events. |
| Feed staleness / health | PASS | `FeedHealthTracker` tested; smoke reports connected health. |
| Paper runtime | NA | Stubbed until later milestones. |
| Replay runtime | NA | Stubbed until later milestones. |
| Resolution-source ingest | PARTIAL | Generic adapter/parser exists; live source verification deferred to section 11 before M5. |

Heartbeat intent for M3:

- Send text `PING` on idle reads.
- Ignore text `PING`/`PONG` as control messages, not feed payloads.
- Respond to WebSocket protocol ping frames with protocol pong frames.
- No heartbeat behavior change is required before M3 commit.

## Next Exit Gate

M4 is complete only when:

- API verification sections 3, 5, and 10 pass.
- Book updates are deterministic.
- Stale state is explicit.
- Decision snapshots are coherent.

## Recent Verification

- Evidence file: `verification/2026-04-26-api-verification.md`.
- M3 evidence file: `verification/2026-04-27-m3-api-verification.md`.
- M2 required sections 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 passed for M2 scope.
- `validate` reached geoblock and reported blocked `US/CA`.
- Gamma keyset discovery listed active BTC/ETH/SOL 15-minute up/down markets.
- Final M2 gate discovered 30 matching markets across 5 pages, persisted 30 records to Postgres, read back 30 records, and emitted 30 lifecycle events.
- `paper` mode failed closed from the blocked geoblock response.
- No live order placement or signing path was added.
- M3 local checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --offline`, `cargo clippy --offline -- -D warnings`, `cargo run --offline -- validate --local-only --config config/default.toml`, and `cargo run -- validate --local-only --feed-smoke --feed-message-limit 1 --config config/default.toml`.
- M3 feed smoke connected read-only to Polymarket CLOB, Binance, and Coinbase.
- M3 feed smoke persisted 6 raw messages and emitted 6 normalized events.
- M3 REST book snapshot recovery probe normalized 1 book snapshot.
- M3 parser/recorder tests cover documented CLOB market WebSocket message types, REST book snapshots, Binance ticks, Coinbase ticks, generic resolution-source ticks, raw+normalized persistence, staleness, heartbeat filtering, and reconnect backoff.

## Blockers And Risks

- M3 API verification sections 4, 5, 9, and 10 are complete for M3 scope.
- M4 must implement actual snapshot/delta reconciliation and state replacement using the M3-verified REST/WebSocket book shapes.
- Local Polymarket geoblock currently reports blocked `US/CA`; this is expected for compliance testing and must remain fail-closed for trading-capable modes.
- CLOB V2 cutover timing is time-sensitive; recheck endpoint assumptions if work continues after the April 28, 2026 cutover window.

## Next Concrete Action

Commit M3 after user approval, then start M4 on a new branch.

M4 first action: implement deterministic order book state that can accept the M3-normalized REST `BookSnapshot` and WebSocket `BookDelta` events, then add tests for snapshot replacement, price-level removal, stale state, and coherent read-only decision snapshots.
